I used MERN Stack because it is a popular stack that developers love to work with because it facilitates the MVC architecture which makes the web development process smooth. Also, the community support for MERN stack is more than any other Stack such as MEAN.

**Challenges I faced:**

•	How should I start the project? 

    This is the most common challenge that every beginner faced in their learning journey.

•	What should I used to store the user information in the front-end?

    As I was beginner before making this project, I was confused about what should I used to store the user information such that it is mutable as well as persistent
    for a long time. After thinking very much I decided that I should use redux and session storage API.

•	How should I render my UI to the user and Admin both?

    I decided to make two different section for User and Admin, where they can separately perform CRUD operations.
